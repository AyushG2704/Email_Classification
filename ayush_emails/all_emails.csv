0,"Greetings from *Student Alumni Relations Cell*! We understand that Batch Snaps and the Yearbook are an integral part of every BITSian=E2=80=99s Life and capture the nostalgic memories of the grad= uating batch. The eventful years spent on the campus with seniors, batchmates and juniors turn into lifelong friendships. The Yearbook and Photos are what capture these memories for years to come. Traditionally, the Batch Snaps are held in the second semester of your pre-final year. However, due to COVID, they were not organized for the past two years. With things being normalized and students back on campus, the Student Alumni Relations Cell is elated to announce that we are organizing the Batch Snaps for FD Batch of 2018 (Single Degree and Dual Degree Students), HD Batch of 2020 and MBA Batch of 2020, tentatively on 19th, 20th and 21st November 2021 (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). This has been planned after extensive discussion and proper permissions from the administration and Director. According to your branch, they will be organized in slots, and every student participating in the Batch Snaps will have to *strictly follow all mandated guidelines*. A comprehensive document will be soon shared with detailed instructions, guidelines and schedule. This mail has been sent so that students can plan their leaves accordingly if they wish to participate in the Batch Snaps. The snaps will be organized on the dates mentioned above unless communicated otherwise due to unavoidable circumstances. Please note that you would be only allowed to enter the venue in your designated slots, and this will be organized just for the students of the graduating batch who are on campus. We are aware that some 2018 FD Single Degree Students are on PS-2. For such students, we would probably organize them next semester if the conditions allow. Please find attached a Document < =3Dsharing> with some frequently asked questions. We encourage you to contact the undersigned if you have any other doubts: Yash Thakker: +91 9725791724 Vidushi Sahay: +91 9871941631 *Regards,* *Student Alumni Relations Cell*",Admin

28,"Dear Faculty Members, Research Scholars and Students, The Teaching-Learning Centre invites articles for the upcoming issue of the newsletter, Taleem. The focus of the upcoming issue is =E2=80=9CEffective Integration of Teaching and Research=E2=80=9D. Please find below a brief description of the topic: Maintaining a healthy balance between teaching and research has been a topic of much discussion. With research publication acquiring more importance in recent times, there has been a major concern that the quality of teaching might be compromised. While the undergraduate students may not be interested in the latest research in the field, teachers are expected to maintain an active research profile. The tendency to think of research and teaching as mutually exclusive aggravates the situation. In the light of these, the next issue of Taleem aims to initiate a discussion on how teachers can think of ways in which teaching and research can be integrated effectively, thereby evolving a model where teaching and research will be complimentary. The Teaching Learning Centre invites articles from faculty members, research scholars, students, and administrators on the above-mentioned topic.

133,"Dear All, We are happy to announce the launch of BITS notice board portal ( The portal will facilitate the posting of general notices to all the user community and to specific targeted groups. Currently all the notices are sent through e-mail. The present system supports mainly three groups namely student, Faculty and staff. The mails can be sent to individual groups or to multiple groups. The present facility does not offer mail delivery to the fine grained targeted email groups causing the individual mailbox cluttering. The team of IPC and SDET has taken up a new initiative and they have created a portal which aims to provide a single dashboard for the posting and access to the various notices/announcements. To begin with , we intend to provide notice posting rights to Head of departments, division heads, faculty-in-charges and unit heads. Once the facility is operationalized, the root email facility will be withdrawn. The individual faculty members will continue to use the Nalanda email/announcement facility to send the course related communication to the students. Hoping for your kind cooperation.

The eventful years spent on the campus with seniors, batchmates and juniors turn into lifelong friendships. The Yearbook and Photos are what capture these memories for years to come.

With things being normalized and students back on campus, the Student Alumni Relations Cell is elated to announce that we are organizing the Batch Snaps for FD Batch of 2018 (Single Degree and Dual Degree Students), HD Batch of 2020 and MBA Batch of 2020, tentatively on 19th, 20th and 21st November 2021 (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). This has been planned after extensive discussion and proper permissions from the administration and Director. According to your branch, they will be organized in slots, and every student participating in the Batch Snaps will have to *strictly follow all mandated guidelines*. A comprehensive document will be soon shared with detailed instructions, guidelines and schedule. This mail has been sent so that students can plan their leaves accordingly if they wish to participate in the Batch Snaps.

189,"Greetings from PARC! I hope this message finds you well and safe. We are a team of students from BITS Pilani working for PARC < (Pilani AtmaNirBhar Resource Center), an organisation set up by the alumni for helping the underprivileged and bring about social development in and around Pilani. We are currently working on a project named Pilani Playscapes and are looking to raise 3.5 lakhs for the cause. Pilani has a shortage of safe and inclusive spaces where children can play and have fun which is very important for the overall development of a child. This project aims at setting up a sustainable and interactive playground in Pilani. The playground would help build a play-cum-learn ecosystem for the young generation of Pilani and accommodate the needs of specially-abled children. Details of the Project: - The playscape would be built on the 5000 sq ft area of the land near the PARC building. The playground is built in collaboration with Anthill Creations, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to bring back play for all age groups by creating sustainable playscapes. - In the long run, a synergy is created with Prayogshala < another PARC initiative dedicated to children development. - The elements of the finalised playscape are Slide Playstation, Balancing Beam, Walker Maze, Tyre Seesaw, Double Swing and Traverse Frames. I am attaching the brochure of the project where you can get the necessary details. Our organisation is conducting a fundraising campaign for the cause.

A decade ago, the typical response to a mention of Consulting Club on the campus would be met by quizzical stares and awkward expressions, while people would try to figure out if they heard it wrong or whether it was some placement company that was in question. The club has managed to propagate consulting as a culture. *What does the club do?* Interactive activities like solving archived case studies, live cases, and guesstimates are focused on, to gain experience and expertise. Various current scenarios and new themes are discussed and debated during the sessions. There are also video conferences with Club Alumni, as well as ex BITSians, placed worldwide in major Consulting Firms, for the members to learn from. *Who can join the club?* Contrary to the popular notion, a background in analytics, finance, or similar subjects is not necessary to join the club! All it requires is logic, common sense, and an urge to learn more. Over the years, club members have cracked top consults including Mckinsey, BCG, Bain & Co., etc., and have taken up challenging roles in related sectors like analytics, business development, and start-ups right after college. *BITS Pilani Consulting Club is now accepting applications from the 2021 and 2020 batches! **There are no prior requisites to join the club, anyone from the 2021 and 2020 batch can apply to the club.* Use BITS mail to open the form. *Google form link for 2021 Batch* Deadline to fill the application forms for first-year students: *17th November 2021 (23:59 pm)* *Google form link for 2020 Batch* Deadline to fill the application forms for second-year students: *14th November 2021 (23:59 pm)* Second-Year students are required to attach their resume in the form, a sample of which is present in the mail below.

235,"Dear Colleagues, Greetings of the day! It would be no exaggeration to say that the Intellectual Property and the product development go hand-in-hand. Every idea starts out with an (unproven) concept, there is a period of struggle, where the entrepreneur works on the idea through the technology and market hurdles to get the product, market fit. The Intellectual Property process can help speed up the pace of innovation significantly and help organizations develop a superior product and better value proposition. Unfortunately lack of knowledge about IPR processes can make it difficult for startups to protect, sell, license or give away the rights of their innovations to others at the right time thereby helping accelerate the rate of innovation so as to recover the investments. Continuing with our ongoing discussion series on IPR, the next topic we have chosen to focus on is *=E2=80=9CIPR Lifecycle: Idea to Market=E2=80= =9D *which would give a holistic view of how Intellectual Property Rights are a key prerequisite in the growth cycle of successful technologies.

As the students have been called on campus to clear their rooms, we are planning to conduct this drive so that they can support the less fortunate people in Pilani by donating the things which they wish to no longer use. Our on ground volunteers will be taking the initiative of delivering these things to the bastis and schools which we have adopted and also in other parts of the town. We are planning to keep the cartons or empty trunks in the common room which would be collected by our volunteers at the end of each day and they will be kept in the room allotted to Nirmaan in the Student Activity Centre= . Then the things would be further delivered to the underprivileged people in Pilani. In order to make this drive successful, we need the support from the Administration for the following things- 1. We need the help of the Institute to provide us with cartons or trunks to store the things donated by the students. 2. We ask for the support from the Superintendent and the Chowkidars from all the hostels to ensure the safety of these cartons or trunks in the common rooms of each hostel. 3. We would also require access to the Nirmaan Room located in the Student Activity Centre. 4. We cordially request your support to circulate the mail attached below to the students of BITS Pilani. Every year, students throw away a lot of things which are in working condition and can be used. So we wish to curb this and put them in the hands of those who really need them and aid them in this pandemic. A little help from our side can make a great difference.

Register Now Editors Pick: LCM of Two Numbers in C The lcm program in C is a very common, beginner-level question asked. Before we delve deeper, we must understand what LCM is. We have all learned HCF and LCM in school, however, we often forget what it is and when it’s used. Let us take a look at LCM, in detail now.

The pay scale is ranged from a minimum of ₹200k per annum to the maximum of ₹1million per annum. The java developer’s salary is significantly higher amongst various other job positions because Read On New and Delete Operator in C++ C++ supports the feature of dynamic memory (that is the allocation of memory or storage space at runtime manually by the programmer) allocation and deallocation of objects using the new and delete operators.

357,"Hi AYUSH, If I handed you a big bucket of assorted LEGO bricks, how would you separat= e them into different piles? By color? Shape? Size? Just like LEGOs, your p= rojects & tasks have different characteristics too: status, importance, urg= ency... With Notion 2.13, you can create groups of items in your databases to get o= rganized on your own terms =E2=80=94 in whatever way makes sense to your br= ain. Try it out ( 2C+personal%2C+version+A&utm_campaigntype=3Dnewsletter&utm_content=3D2.12+r= elease+email%2C+personal%2C+version+A&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_source=3Dcusto= mer.io ) (1) Create groups in Timeline, Table, List & Gallery views Click the new Group button to visually organize your content by whatever pr= operty makes sense for your workflow. Each group includes a toggle to the l= eft, so you can quickly hide and show groups to focus on what you need. (2) Create groups and sub-groups in Board view Already grouping your tasks in Board view? Now you can create sub-groups of= those tasks organized by any other property, all while keeping your origin= al columns intact. (3) Group by more properties, including Relation properties Before, you could only group your items based off of Select, Multi-select, = and Person properties. Now nearly every property type is supported, includi= ng Relation, Number, Date and more. (4) More features we launched this month We're always improving Notion based on your feedback. Here's the latest: * Bullet lists now default to alternating between discs, circles & squares = at each level of indentation * You can now show & hide all database properties with one click in the ""Pr= operties"" dropdown menu * On mobile, tap the =F0=9F=92=AC icon at the top right to see a consolidat= ed view of comments (5) Notion is now available in Japanese We're excited to take a big step toward making Notion feel native and intui= tive to millions more people. Starting now, Japanese language is available = in beta! Go to Settings & members =E2=86=92 Language & region to change your languag= e on desktop, or your device settings to change your language on mobile.

That's the beauty of grouping in Notion = =E2=80=94 everyone can create processes & systems to meet their own needs, = with more flexibility than ever before.

As we humans use languages to understand and communicate with each other, Computers and other Digital Systems use Binary. It is a base-2 number system having only two numbers, 0 & 1 which corresponds to ON & OFF states that your computer can understand. As normal humans have 10 fingers to represent a simple number system called Decimal, computers have these ON & OFF states representing Binary. So to understand and interpret the binary we need some technique to convert binary code into decimal (human-readable) code and vice versa. Thus in this article, we will discuss how to convert decimal to binary and vice versa, in context with one of the computer programming language-Python. Understanding Decimal and Binary Decimal System(Base-10) makes use of ten numbers ranging from 0 to 9 and then uses their combinations to form digits, with each digit being worth ten times more than the last digit (1, 10, 100, so-on) going from left to right. Consider a value 265: Here 265 is a combination for numbers ranging from 0 to 9 to form each digit Each digit is ten times more than the last digit going from left to right 5 -> 5×100;  6 -> 6×101;  2 -> 2×102 Binary System(Base-2) is also similar, it is a combination of numbers 0 or 1 with each digit being worth two times more than the last digit(1, 2, 4, so-on) going from left to right. Decimal Digit Representation: … [0 to 9] [0 to 9] [0 to 9] [0 to 9] [0 to 9] … 104 103 102 101 100 Nth digit 5th digit 4th digit 3rd digit 2nd digit 1st digit Similarly, Binary Digit Representation: … [0 to 1] [0 to 1] [0 to 1] [0 to 1] [0 to 1] … 24 23 22 21 20 Nth digit 5th digit 4th digit 3rd digit 2nd digit 1st digit Binary to Decimal Conversion in Python We have already seen that the Binary System is a combination of [0 or 1] with each digit being worth two times more than the last digit, so let’s see how this information will help us to convert binary to decimal equivalent. Consider a Binary Number 01011 Digit 0 1 0 1 1 Weight 24=16 23=8 22=4 21=2 20=1 Hence, (01011)2 = ( 0x24) + (1×23) + (0x22) + (1×21) + (1×20) =(0) + (8) + (0) + (2) + (1) =(11)10 Therefore, the binary(base-2) (01011)2 is equivalent to (11)10 Decimal(base-10) number.   Read On   Decimal to Binary Conversion in Python Let’s try to understand the decimal to binary conversion. The easiest technique to convert the decimal numbers to their binary equivalent is the Division by 2. In Division by 2 technique, we continuously divide a decimal number by 2 and note the reminder, till we get 1 as our input value, and then we read the noted reminders in reverse order to get the final binary value. Let’s break the earlier statements to get more clarity. Assume we have a special function that divides the input number by 2 and gives the remainder as output. For decimal to binary, we call this special function multiple times till we get the 1 as input value. Then, at last, we print all the saved reminders to get the final binary(base-2) value.

507,"Dear All, Greetings from Practice School Division. Practice School-I (PS-I) is an integral part of the curriculum of BITS Pilani, offered to First Degree students at the end of their second year of the degree programme, during the summer. PS-I is an exposure-oriented course of an eight-week duration, the goal of which is to provide students an opportunity to observe how the workplace functions and help them apply the knowledge gained during their studies in the workplace. PS-I helps students nurture their professional, cognitive, and technical skills and host organizations by the enthusiastic participation and contribution of students to their ongoing work at their working premises. PS-I is monitored and evaluated by a resident faculty, who conducts the program, in consultation with the host organization coordinator. PS-I faculty is ably supported by student co-instructors and faculty co-instructors in operational and technical aspects, respectively. Keeping the largest interest of wider knowledge dissemination, PSD is happy to bring forth the second edition of the PS-I Chronicles featuring over 1800 articles from PS-I students sharing their experiences during summer 2021. The basic premise behind the release of PS-I Chronicles is to document the PS-I learning experience of students keeping the below objectives in view. 1. To provide more information on the learning experiences by immediate senior students and PS-I faculty about stations, thereby enlightening the student community's learning opportunity. 2. To provide the faculty with enhanced information about the type and nature of work carried out at the organization. 3. To transform the knowledge gained at the organization into classroom teaching and identify the scope of deepening the collaborations with the organization. The articles have been classified into five categories based on the industry domain. Chronicle 1: Information Technology Chronicle 2: Electronics Chronicle 3: Chemical, Mechanical, Cement, Textile, Steel, and Infrastructure Chronicle 4: Health Care and others Chronicle 5: Finance and Management PSD hopes that these PS-I chronicles will help every reader acknowledge the type of work done by students in PS-I and provide the necessary feedback path to bridge the industry-academia gap. The chronicles are a must-read for prospective PS-I Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS I Stations. It will also help the student to identify his/her interest and hence enhance the scope of making an informed choice while filling the preference forms for PS-I. The third edition of the PS-I chronicles is available at the following link: Thank you Prof. Gaikwad Anil Bhanudas Associate Dean, PSD, Pilani campus",Intern/Placement

In the ET sector, we have esteemed speakers like Rahul (Interned at Nvidia), Piyush Raj Jha (Placed at Expressif Systems) and Ananya Khandelwal (Interned and placed at Micron Technologies). In mechanical core, we have Kanishk Chaudhary (Interned at Boston Scientific) giving his insights on the placement process. The links for the same are as attached below- 1. ET podcast < 2.

Nice to write an email to all Chemical Engineering faculty of BITS Family. I understand that you are all busy with just concluded mid semester tests and post test formalities. Forwarded mail talks about a webinar titled "" Changing Face of Chemical Engineering-Future Prospects and Career Opportunities"" being organized by our department in collaboration with IIChE-Hyd Regional Centre on 31st Oct-1st Nov (2-3 hours a day only). This is purely aimed at our UG students (including 1st year as they would be completely unaware of the discipline) and of course ME too . To be candid, we need to admit that many. If not all, students of Chemical Engineering across the campuses are slightly disinterested in their core discipline and are more inclined towards IT or Finance due to their own reasons. Though there is nothing wrong in it per se, we thought that we need to enlighten them about the beauty of our discipline and its wide interdisciplinary outreach by inviting speakers from Chem Engg background working in diverse industries like ONGC, space research, materials, simulation and theoretical work etc. This is a small attempt to make them closer to their branch and appreciate it better with pride. I request all of you to make it convenient to attend the same (by registering in a simple google form-free) and advise our chemical engineering students of all campuses to make use of this opportunity by attending the same. Please disseminate the information to all those interested outside too. PS: Please advise all participants to register online (free) Thanking you in anticipation, best wishes, Dr I Sreedhar, (*On behalf of our organizing team Dr Satyapaul A Singh, Dr Afkham Mir and Dr Iyman Abrar)* Professor and Head, Department of Chemical Engineering, BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, Jawaharnagar, Medchal-Malakjgiri District, Hyderabad- 500078 Ph: 040-66303512 (O) Mob: 9010202948 (M) ---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Afkham Mir Date: Sat, Oct 23, 2021 at 11:39 AM Subject: 2 Day Webinar on THE CHANGiNG FACE OF CHEMiCAL ENGiNEERiNG : FUTURE PROSPECTS AND CAREER OPPURTUNiTiES To: Arnab Dutta , Balaji Krishnamurthy , D Purnima < dpurnima@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Debirupa Mitra < debirupa@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Dr. Satyapaul Singh < satyapaul@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Inkollu Sreedhar < isreedhar@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Iyman Abrar < iyman@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Jaideep Chatterjee < jaideepc@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Karthik Chethan V < kvenk@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Nandini Bhandaru < nandini@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Pankaj Kumar < pankajkumar@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Ramesh Adusumalli < ramesh.babu@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Srikanta Dinda < srikantadinda@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Ved Prakash Mishra < vpmishra@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Vikranth Kumar Surasani < surasani@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Ramendra Kishor Pal < ramendra.pal@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in> Dear Sir/Mam Greetings of the day.

688,"Greetings from NSS, BITS Pilani! The relationship between seniors and juniors at BITS is a special one. College seniors are supposed to be the first mentors for the young adults far from home. But sometimes, in the name of introduction or initiation, millions of students are brutally abused in many educational institutions. Ragging and bullying are one of the leading causes of mental health depreciation among students. Thus to change, spread awareness, and take action, NSS, BITS PILANI has collaborated with S.A.V.E : Society Against Violence in Education and invited Mr. Ajay Govind, Mr. Gaurav Singhal and Mr. Shivam Yadav to enlighten about the harmful effects of ragging and help us formulate a strong anti-ragging mindset. About the Speakers Ajay Govind is an award-winning filmmaker, educator and anti-ragging activist. Being a graduate of St. Stephen's College (Delhi University), he has interacted with over 15,000 participants. Ajay's anti-ragging documentary film 'Thereby Hangs a Tale' has won accolades all across India and has been associated with S.A.V.E.,(no2ragging.org) since last about a decade when one of his close friends lost his life due to ragging. Gaurav Singhal is Vice-President and the R.T.I. Cell Head of S.A.V.E. Perturbed with the murder of a medical student in the name of ragging in 2009, he joined the Anti-Ragging N.G.O. S.A.V.E. Gaurav Singhal has also appeared at various media like T.V., FM and Newspapers over the last few years to spread awareness about the ragging issues. He was also invited to Aamir Khan's show Satyamev Jayate to highlight the ragging problem in India. Shivam Yadav, a pharma graduate, contacted SAVE as a victim in 2013 during his college days and later started volunteering for SAVE. He provides counselling for ragging victims and works in the Victim Supports Team of SAVE and is instrumental in filing R.T.I.s to colleges and government authorities and monitoring the cases in National AntiRagging Helpline. We cordially invite you to the webinar, which commences 3:00 PM on October 10, Sunday.

It gives me immense pleasure to personally invite you to the 2nd part of our Discourse : Bhagav= ad Gita for Youth. We were enthused to see active participation from the students in the 1st part of the Discourse and we are feeling extreme delight to again invite all the brilliant minds to take advantage of the jewel of the wisdom of Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita is said to contain R=C4=81ja-vidy=C4=81 i.e. the highest of a= ll knowledge and R=C4=81ja-guhya=E1=B9=81, i.e. the most confidential knowledg= e=E2=80=A6. r=C4=81ja-vidy=C4=81 r=C4=81ja-guhya=E1=B9=81 pavitram idam uttamam pratyak=E1=B9=A3=C4=81vagama=E1=B9=81 dharmya=E1=B9=81 su-sukha=E1=B9=81 kartum avyayam This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.

754,"Dear All *Greeting from CIIE-BITS Pilani* The role of intellectual property in the educational/research activity of universities has greatly increased. Every researcher hopes that their work is innovative and unique. To be protected by the law the new development should be patentable (novel and inventive). The journey from the conception of an idea, filing an application to the grant of a patent can often be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a preliminary search of prior art to get an idea of what technology already exists. It is, therefore, necessary for academic researchers to carry out a patent search before they begin to avoid repeating work that others have already done. A patent search may not only help inventors decide whether to pursue research but also allows them to find out avenues to modify their efforts to improve the probability of getting a patent. We invite your cordial presence in Virtual *WORKSHOP ON IMPORTANCE OF PATENT SEARCH* on *8th September 2021 at 5:00 PM.* *Registration* Registration for the workshop is free of cost.

759,"APPCAIR presents: Guest Virtual Talk by Dr. Arindam Pal *Speaker: *Dr. Arindam Pal, Senior Research Scientist (Data61, CSIRO and CSCRC) *Title of the *talk*: *""A New Algorithm to Compute the Influence of Users and Posts in Online Social Networks"" Date: 31st August 2021 (Tuesday) Time: 04:00 PM *Webinar Link: *meet.google.com/qif-eyxd-vvm *Abstract of the Talk:* Ranking users and items plays an important role in social network analysis. Many prominent methods have been developed for vertex ranking in unipartite networks and bipartite networks. However, unipartite network ranking focuses on ranking for homogeneous networks, where vertices are of the same type; bipartite network ranking targets the task of ranking for bipartite networks, where vertices are of two different types, but it only considers the inter-type links. In this paper, we study the problem of ranking vertices of heterogeneous bipartite networks, where the intra-type links and the inter-type links co-exist in networks. We present a novel solution, VRank, which iteratively assigns scores to users and items based on their mutual reinforcement and finally converges to a unique stationary ranking. We prove that VRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization function, which enables the extension of VRank to the more generic heterogeneous n-partite networks. To illustrate its functionality, we apply VRank on various real-world social networks. The experimental results demonstrate VRank's effectiveness, efficiency and fast convergence. *Speaker's Bio: * Prof. Navneet Goyal Coordinator: APPCAIR AI Research Center, Pilani Campus",Formal

772,"APPCAIR presents: Guest Virtual Talk by Dr. Arindam Pal *Speaker: *Dr. Arindam Pal, Senior Research Scientist (Data61, CSIRO and CSCRC) *Title of the *talk*: *""A New Algorithm to Compute the Influence of Users and Posts in Online Social Networks"" Date: 31st August 2021 (Tuesday) Time: 04:00 PM *Webinar Link: *meet.google.com/qif-eyxd-vvm *Abstract of the Talk:* Ranking users and items plays an important role in social network analysis. Many prominent methods have been developed for vertex ranking in unipartite networks and bipartite networks. However, unipartite network ranking focuses on ranking for homogeneous networks, where vertices are of the same type; bipartite network ranking targets the task of ranking for bipartite networks, where vertices are of two different types, but it only considers the inter-type links. In this paper, we study the problem of ranking vertices of heterogeneous bipartite networks, where the intra-type links and the inter-type links co-exist in networks. We present a novel solution, VRank, which iteratively assigns scores to users and items based on their mutual reinforcement and finally converges to a unique stationary ranking. We prove that VRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization function, which enables the extension of VRank to the more generic heterogeneous n-partite networks. To illustrate its functionality, we apply VRank on various real-world social networks. The experimental results demonstrate VRank's effectiveness, efficiency and fast convergence. *Speaker's Bio: * Prof. Navneet Goyal Coordinator: APPCAIR AI Research Center, Pilani Campus -- Thanks & regards",Formal
773,"Greetings from APPCAIR! The sixth talk of the APPCAIR Research Seminar series is scheduled as below: *Speaker:* Dr. Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy (BITS Hyderabad) *Title of the *talk*: *""An Algorithmic Barrier to Neural Circuit Understanding < Date: 11th November 2021 (Thursday) Time: 04:00 PM *Google Meet Link: * *Abstract of the talk: *Neuroscience is witnessing extraordinary progress in experimental techniques, especially at the neural circuit level. These advances are largely aimed at enabling us to understand precisely how neural circuit computations mechanistically cause behaviour. Establishing this type of causal understanding will require multiple perturbational (e.g optogenetic) experiments. It has been unclear exactly how many such experiments are needed and how this number scales with the size of the nervous system in question. Here, using techniques from Theoretical Computer Science, we prove that establishing the most extensive notions of understanding need exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons, in many cases, unless P = NP. Furthermore, using data and estimates, we demonstrate that the feasible experimental regime is typically one where the number of experiments one can perform scales sub-linearly in the number of neurons in typical nervous systems. This remarkable gulf between the worst-case and the feasible suggests an algorithmic barrier to such an understanding. Determining which notions of understanding are algorithmically tractable to establish in what contexts, thus, becomes an important new direction for investigation. will also close with some speculation on if similar results might be true of sufficiently complex AI systems. (No prior Neuroscience background will be assumed for the talk.) best regards Prof. Navneet Goyal Coordinator: APPCAIR AI Research Center, Pilani _______________________________________",Formal

In recent times the protection of Computer-Related Inventions (CRIs) is one of the most widely debated and contentious issues in the country and rest of the world as well.

Coming from a very modest background Kunal is a self-made serial entrepreneur who is no stranger to financial hardship or the unglamorous and excruciating reality of what it takes to make it big in the startup scene. He has always been outspoken about the fact that coding is not the most important factor when it comes to building a successful startup and that is instead simply a means to an end. He maintains that most of the make-or-break skills needed for a startup to flourish are difficult to identify for someone new to the game and do not come from an engineering or MBA degree. Some of his core beliefs are: i)The ability to ask dumb questions is a ""super-power"". ii) Hiring multi-faceted individuals is key. iii)Highlighting Paranoia and Curiosity as key qualities that push a person forward. iv)The importance of collaborating and hunting in packs instead of treating ventures as a zero-sum game. v)The importance of experimenting and making new mistakes.

There would be a penalty for each minute for a late submission. 5. Be ready to show the 360-degree view when asked by the invigilator. 6. Do not send me your files by Email as this would mean that you have not done the things on time. 7. You can use ebook or lecture slides (but certainly not lecture videos).

At any= point in time, if the invigilator finds that you were using the Internet and browsing, your exam would be canceled and the matter would be reported to DC. 2.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0You would use Mettl to see the question paper and upl= oad the answers. You would solve all the questions on A4 size sheets, scan them with your mobile, name the file with your BITS ID, and upload it on mettl. 3.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Your exam would start at sharp 5:00 PM and end at sha= rp 5:45 PM. You should stop writing at 5:45 PM. After that, you will get 5 minutes to upload the answers. I strictly repeat that during these 5 minutes you should not write and only upload. 4.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0You should ensure proper continuous Internet connecti= vity and other things required. The exam time would not be measured using the clock of Mettl; it would go by the physical clock. I would send announcements periodically on mettl. Please understand that this decision is taken so that sincere student is not penalized. There would be a penalty for each minute for a late submission. 5. Be ready to show the 360-degree view when asked by the invigilator. 6. Do not send me your files by Email as this would mean that you have not done the things on time. 7. You can use ebook or lecture slides (but certainly not lecture videos). Download these beforehand. 8. Test link would be shared on Nalanda before the test. You can keep Nalanda open in a tab during the test. In case of emergency (i.e. if anything goes wrong during the test), check the announcement section of Nalanda. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Change your forum digest preferences:",Academic
