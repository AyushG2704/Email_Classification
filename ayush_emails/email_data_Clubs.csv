We understand that Batch Snaps and the Yearbook are an integral part of
every BITSian=E2=80=99s Life and capture the nostalgic memories of the grad=
uating
batch. The eventful years spent on the campus with seniors, batchmates and
juniors turn into lifelong friendships. The Yearbook and Photos are what
capture these memories for years to come.

Traditionally, the Batch Snaps are held in the second semester of your
pre-final year. However, due to COVID, they were not organized for the past
two years. With things being normalized and students back on campus, the
Student Alumni Relations Cell is elated to announce that we are organizing
the Batch Snaps for FD Batch of 2018 (Single Degree and Dual Degree
Students), HD Batch of 2020 and MBA Batch of 2020, tentatively on 19th,
20th and 21st November 2021 (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).

This has been planned after extensive discussion and proper permissions
from the administration and Director. According to your branch, they will
be organized in slots, and every student participating in the Batch Snaps
will have to *strictly follow all mandated guidelines*. A comprehensive
document will be soon shared with detailed instructions, guidelines and
schedule. This mail has been sent so that students can plan their leaves
accordingly if they wish to participate in the Batch Snaps.

The snaps will be organized on the dates mentioned above unless
communicated otherwise due to unavoidable circumstances. Please note that
you would be only allowed to enter the venue in your designated slots, and
this will be organized just for the students of the graduating batch who
are on campus.

We are aware that some 2018 FD Single Degree Students are on PS-2. For such
students, we would probably organize them next semester if the conditions
allow. Please find attached a Document

I hope this message finds you well and safe. We are a team of students
from BITS
Pilani working for PARC <https://atmanirbhar.org/> (Pilani AtmaNirBhar
Resource Center), an organisation set up by the alumni for helping the
underprivileged and bring about social development in and around Pilani.


We are currently working on a project named Pilani Playscapes and are
looking to raise 3.5 lakhs for the cause.


Pilani has a shortage of safe and inclusive spaces where children can play
and have fun which is very important for the overall development of a
child. This project aims at setting up a sustainable and interactive
playground in Pilani. The playground would help build a play-cum-learn
ecosystem for the young generation of Pilani and accommodate the needs of
specially-abled children.


Details of the Project:

   -

   The playscape would be built on the 5000 sq ft area of the land near the
   PARC building. The playground is built in collaboration with Anthill
   Creations, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to bring back play for
   all age groups by creating sustainable playscapes.
   -

   In the long run, a synergy is created with Prayogshala
   <https://atmanirbhar.org/student-projects>, another PARC initiative
   dedicated to children development.
   -

   The elements of the finalised playscape are Slide Playstation, Balancing
   Beam, Walker Maze, Tyre Seesaw, Double Swing and Traverse Frames.


I am attaching the brochure of the project where you can get the necessary
details.


Our organisation is conducting a fundraising campaign for the cause. We
would be grateful if you could support our efforts by contributing to the
cause.

Greetings from NSS BITS Pilani,

Hope you are doing well on campus with the best health=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6..!=
!

As we all are on campus again, you may find some things around you which
are of no use for you, but can be Reused & Recycled. Every year, many such
products undergo wastage due to lack of management.

Taking this into consideration in accordance with Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav
Swacha Bharat Abhiyan 2.0, NSS BITS Pilani has arranged for a Collection
Drive of such products from the common rooms of hostels during 7th October
to 17th October.

Our volunteers would be setting up cartons in the common room of the
respective hostels wherein you can put up your Old Notebooks, Textbooks &
Spare Papers in the cartons.

[image: ONCD Poster.png]

Why to donate?

   1.

   Cleanliness: Clearing unused things from the rooms would create more
   space and a pleasant environment for the students.
   2.

   Monetary Help: The funds raised after selling the things would be
   utilised for development of the library in the NSS Building.
   3.

   Joy of satisfaction: The feeling of satisfaction you get after
   completing a donation is priceless and unique.


The collected products will be sold to the vendors outside the campus under
the supervision of higher authorities of the organization.

We would take care of whatever you are donating goes to the right place.

With Best Regards,

NSS BITS Pilani.

Recruitments | BITS Pilani Consulting Club,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Mon, 8 Nov 2021 11:57:23 +0530","*Greetings from BITS Pilani Consulting Club!*


From a bunch of college-goers interested in the field of Consulting to a
full-fledged group of over 20+ members focused on broadening their horizons
and opportunities in the industry, the club sure has come a long way. A
decade ago, the typical response to a mention of Consulting Club on the
campus would be met by quizzical stares and awkward expressions, while
people would try to figure out if they heard it wrong or whether it was
some placement company that was in question. The club has managed to
propagate consulting as a culture.


*What does the club do?*

Interactive activities like solving archived case studies, live cases, and
guesstimates are focused on, to gain experience and expertise. Various
current scenarios and new themes are discussed and debated during the
sessions. There are also video conferences with Club Alumni, as well as ex
BITSians, placed worldwide in major Consulting Firms, for the members to
learn from.


*Who can join the club?*
Contrary to the popular notion, a background in analytics, finance, or
similar subjects is not necessary to join the club! All it requires is
logic, common sense, and an urge to learn more. Over the years, club
members have cracked top consults including Mckinsey, BCG, Bain & Co.,
etc., and have taken up challenging roles in related sectors like
analytics, business development, and start-ups right after college.



*BITS Pilani Consulting Club is now accepting applications from the
2021 and 2020 batches! **There are no prior requisites to join the club,
anyone from the 2021 and 2020 batch can apply to the club.*

Yearbook Portal 2022,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Sat, 18 Sep 2021 12:58:06 +0530","Greetings from the Student Alumni Relations Cell!

The Yearbook is a dedicated volume that captures the nostalgic memories of
the graduating batch of an institute. The eventful years spent on the
campus are engraved and expressed with photos and write-ups, a reminder of
all the good times. Years down the line, when you look back, the yearbook
will light up faded memories of walking down the NAB slope, late-night chai
at ANC, birthday celebrations at -301 F, rushing for tutorials at the last
minute and sleepless nights in the library before every exam. Visuals from
these old, fleeting moments, photographs of your batchmates, stills from
Oasis, inspiring words from your professors, and the aroma of all the food
you made your wingies pay for will remind you of the institute that
assisted you as you built yourself from the ground up.



The Student Alumni Relations Cell works throughout the year to publish the
yearbook for the graduating class every year. This edition of the yearbook
is exclusively meant for the *First Degree batch of 2018* (single degree
and dual degree) and the *Higher Degree Batch of 2020*.

We're excited to launch the Yearbook Portal 2022
<https://yearbook.bits-sarc.org/>, a gateway to your college memories where
you can post crazy pictures and interesting captions for yourselves and
your friends. It is an effort from our side to help you relive your college
life and capture those beautiful memories that you shared with your
seniors, batchies and juniors.

Log into the Yearbook Portal <https://yearbook.bits-sarc.org/>

Please fill out the form <https://forms.gle/bbrjoVVt6kdroFbs5> if you wish
to *feature any of your captured photos of the campus* in the Yearbook or
have any concerns/queries.

As an attempt to clarify the numerous queries that might arise regarding
the Yearbook Portal, we would like to clarify a few points:-


   1.

   There is a no-limit rule to the captions you can write about your
   friends!
   2.

   The deadline to fill your Yearbook Quote and Photo will be 10th October,
   2021
   3.

   A printed hard copy of the Yearbook will be made available (the opt-in
   form will be shared later).
   4.

   The hardcopy would contain your caption, a.k.a yearbook quote with your
   picture.
   5.

   You can modify your yearbook quote before the deadline through the edit
   profile option. The entered yearbook quotes should be limited to 140
   characters or 25 words.
   6.

   Quotes to be written only in English (Important: Please refrain from
   using any expletives or Devanagari script).
   7.

   No emojis are to be used in the quotes.
   8.

   Please refrain from using photos with multiple people in them.
   9.

Respected Sir,



Greetings from PARC Student Division. I hope you and your family are doing
well.

We are pleased to inform you that the fundraiser for the Playscapes project
has gone live on the ketto website and we have started raising funds to
reach our target. You can find the link for the fundraiser below.

We are extremely sorry for the delay caused in setting up the fundraiser.
Unfortunately, we experienced an unexpected delay because of some
documentation issues with ketto which have now been solved.


As promised, we have attached the content and the poster for social media
outreach. It would be a great help if you could post them on your social
media accounts. We have also attached the root mail to be sent to the
faculty and students as promised.

We are grateful for the support you have given us in the project and will
work tirelessly to make this project a success. We will be looking forward
to your reply.

make it overwhelming to comprehend the head and tail of it. But at its very
core,* politics is about citizen problem-solving and not just about
elections*. Most of the time, politicians begin as community leaders and
citizen problem-solvers, and understanding this is key to fixing our
country's political system. Their problem is that they don't stick to
principles, so they resort to unethical methods when difficulties arise.
The country looks up to its best institutions for leadership. BITS Pilani

leaders. *Now,

"[Meity-sthub] IPR Lifecycle: Idea to Market: Take this Quiz to Test
 Your Understanding","""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:46:13 +0530","Dear Colleagues,


Greetings of the day!


It would be no exaggeration to say that the Intellectual Property and the
product development go hand-in-hand. Every idea starts out with an
(unproven) concept, there is a period of struggle, where the entrepreneur
works on the idea through the technology and market hurdles to get the
product, market fit. The Intellectual Property process can help speed up
the pace of innovation significantly and help organizations develop a
superior product and better value proposition.


Unfortunately lack of knowledge about IPR processes can make it difficult
for startups to protect, sell, license or give away the rights of their
innovations to others at the right time thereby helping accelerate the rate
of innovation so as to recover the investments.


Continuing with our ongoing discussion series on IPR, the next topic we
have chosen to focus on is  *=E2=80=9CIPR Lifecycle: Idea to Market=E2=80=
=9D *which would
give a holistic view of how Intellectual Property Rights are a key
prerequisite in the growth cycle of successful technologies.


We have designed this small quiz to test your understanding about the IPR
lifecycle process and building intellectual assets.

FIT-BITS Challenge- BITSians' Day,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Fri, 6 Aug 2021 09:49:27 +0530"," Greetings from *Student Alumni Relations Cell, BITS Pilani, Goa campus!*
What better way to enter *BITSians' Day* than with many endorphins and
dopamine bursting out of our system!

We present to you *FIT-BITS*, a fitness competition in collaboration with
*Burncal*.
BurnCal is a *BITSian startup*. The platform was born out of COVID, as
people struggled to find consistency with fitness due to a lack of
convenient options.
BurnCal's proprietary computer vision-based technology tracks the posture
and counts repetitions in real-time during workouts ensuring
their members get complete attention even while working out from home
without having a trainer with them. etc. Along with nutritional guidance,
it provides personal coaching with technology to make fitness a lifestyle.

A set of three challenges that will be AI monitored to help you do it at
your convenience at the same time not compromising on the form.
(A simple link will be provided. No extra installation required). This
software can be accessed on both laptops and tablets.

The *3 challenges* are as follows:

   - *Squats*
   - *Jumping Jacks*
   - *Pushups*


The state-of-the-art motion tracking engine of BurnCal will be counting
your reps. For Squats and Push-Ups, posture feedback will be given while
counting your reps.
These competitions are completely free.

*Guidelines:*
- Final scoring will be rep-based. Each challenge will be 3 minutes and the
winner will be decided on the basis of max reps in 3 mins.
- All contestants are encouraged to upload a screenshot of them attempting
the challenge and tagging *@bitsgoa_arc
<https://www.instagram.com/bitsgoa_arc/?hl=en>* and *@getburncal
<https://www.instagram.com/getburncal/>* from their Instagram handles.
   Use *#bitsiansday*.
- A leaderboard with scores of the contestants will be regularly conveyed
on that day from ARC Goa's Instagram handle.
- The top 10 winners in each challenge will get a chance to bypass the
waitlist to BurnCal's beta membership and also additionally avail 20%
discount.
- Winners of all three challenges will get a customized yoga mat along with
their name and a fitness quote.
- The challenge will be active from *6th August 2021, 6 AM IST to 7th
August 2021, 12 noon IST*.

handle the invigilation keeping the participant's privacy in mind.

Nirmaan Donation Drive,Oishika Sarkar <bitspilani.vicepresident@nirmaan.org>,"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 23:37:40 +0530","NIRMAAN DONATION DRIVE

Greetings from BITS Pilani Nirmaan Organization, Pilani Chapter

=E2=80=9CGiving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a
difference!=E2=80=9D

As we are being called to campus to clear our rooms, you may find that
there are a lot of things which you have no use for right now and wish to
dispose of. Nirmaan volunteers present you with an opportunity to donate
these things to the less fortunate people of Pilani. Our ground volunteers
will be donating these in the bastis and schools which we have adopted.

*Why donate?*

Every year, when students leave the campus, a lot of things are disposed of
which are still in good condition. It would be a great opportunity for you
to help the people of Pilani who cannot afford them. You can give *clothes,
shoes, stationary, or anything* which is in a working condition and you
have no use for them. This initiative will help us to provide our
beneficiaries with things which can make their lives better as the current
pandemic has been a blow to the small amount they were earning.

 In order to donate, please follow these steps:

   1.

   We will be providing you with cartons in the common rooms where you can
   put in the things you wish to donate.



   1.

   You will be provided with a QR code (PFA) which you need to scan and put

Nirmaan Donation Drive,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Mon, 5 Jul 2021 17:20:08 +0530","Good afternoon sir,

On behalf of our faculty incharge, Dr. Ashish Tiwari sir, I, Rimen Kaur,
currently the President of Nirmaan Organization, Pilani chapter, wish to
propose to you the idea of conducting a Donation Drive for the students of
BITS Pilani.

As the students have been called on campus to clear their rooms, we are
planning  to conduct this drive so that they can support the less fortunate
people in Pilani by donating the things which they wish to no longer use.
Our on ground volunteers will be taking the initiative of delivering these
things to the bastis and schools which we have adopted and also in other
parts of the town.

We are planning to keep the cartons or empty trunks in the common room
which would be collected by our volunteers at the end of each day and they
will be kept in the room allotted to Nirmaan in the Student Activity Centre=
.
Then the things would be further delivered to the underprivileged people in
Pilani.

In order to make this drive successful, we need the support from the
Administration for the following things-

   1.

   We need the help of the Institute to provide us with cartons or trunks
   to store the things donated by the students.
   2.

   We ask for the support from the Superintendent and the Chowkidars from
   all the hostels to ensure the safety of these cartons or trunks in the
   common rooms of each hostel.
   3.

   We would also require access to the Nirmaan Room located in the Student
   Activity Centre.
   4.

   We cordially request your support to circulate the mail attached below
   to the students of BITS Pilani.


Every year, students throw away a lot of things which are in working
condition and can be used. So we wish to curb this and put them in the
hands of those who really need them and aid them in this pandemic. A little
help from our side can make a great difference.

We seek your support to make this Donation drive a success.



Regards

Rimen Kaur
