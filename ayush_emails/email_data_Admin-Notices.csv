Batch Snaps 2021 | Tentative Dates and Announcement,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Mon, 8 Nov 2021 18:13:17 +0530","Greetings from *Student Alumni Relations Cell*!

We understand that Batch Snaps and the Yearbook are an integral part of
every BITSian=E2=80=99s Life and capture the nostalgic memories of the grad=
uating
batch. The eventful years spent on the campus with seniors, batchmates and
juniors turn into lifelong friendships. The Yearbook and Photos are what
capture these memories for years to come.

Traditionally, the Batch Snaps are held in the second semester of your
pre-final year. However, due to COVID, they were not organized for the past
two years. With things being normalized and students back on campus, the
Student Alumni Relations Cell is elated to announce that we are organizing
the Batch Snaps for FD Batch of 2018 (Single Degree and Dual Degree
Students), HD Batch of 2020 and MBA Batch of 2020, tentatively on 19th,
20th and 21st November 2021 (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).

This has been planned after extensive discussion and proper permissions
from the administration and Director. According to your branch, they will
be organized in slots, and every student participating in the Batch Snaps
will have to *strictly follow all mandated guidelines*. A comprehensive
document will be soon shared with detailed instructions, guidelines and
schedule. This mail has been sent so that students can plan their leaves
accordingly if they wish to participate in the Batch Snaps.

The snaps will be organized on the dates mentioned above unless
communicated otherwise due to unavoidable circumstances. Please note that
you would be only allowed to enter the venue in your designated slots, and
this will be organized just for the students of the graduating batch who
are on campus.

We are aware that some 2018 FD Single Degree Students are on PS-2. For such
students, we would probably organize them next semester if the conditions
allow. Please find attached a Document

"Call for Submission of Articles for Taleem, TLC Newsletter","""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:37:40 +0530","Dear Faculty Members, Research Scholars and Students,



The Teaching-Learning Centre invites articles for the upcoming issue of the
newsletter, Taleem. The focus of the upcoming issue is =E2=80=9CEffective
Integration of Teaching and Research=E2=80=9D. Please find below a brief
description of the topic:





Maintaining a healthy balance between teaching and research has been a
topic of much discussion. With research publication acquiring more
importance in recent times, there has been a major concern that the quality
of teaching might be compromised. While the undergraduate students may not
be interested in the latest research in the field, teachers are expected to
maintain an active research profile. The tendency to think of research and
teaching as mutually exclusive aggravates the situation. In the light of
these, the next issue of Taleem aims to initiate a discussion on how
teachers can think of ways in which teaching and research can be integrated
effectively, thereby evolving a model where teaching and research will be
complimentary.



The Teaching Learning Centre invites articles from faculty members,
research scholars, students, and administrators on the above-mentioned
topic. We request you to send us your valuable contributions on any aspect
of the questions of =E2=80=9CEffective Integration of Teaching and Research=
=E2=80=9D with
an approximate limit of four hundred words. You can also contribute to
cartoons, memes, etc.

Hostel Allotment (Revised),Chief Warden <chiefwarden@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>,"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 09:51:00 +0530","Dear Student,

Please find the revised list of allotments. We understand that many of you
are not getting a room as per your expectations. Remember one thing, once
you are on campus and meeting your friends, I am sure that you will forget
all the grievances you are having. In this phase, we have called the
students based on the availability of locked rooms. The data is very
dynamic due to many reasons.

Please find your allotment of the room from the
http://swd.bits-pilani.ac.in/Login.aspx.

Here are general answers to the queries you have posted.


*Common Queries:*

*1. Want a single room but have been allotted a double room?*



*We are aware of the fact that some of the rooms have been left unoccupied.
This is due to inadequate data because of the fast and dynamic process in
the current scenario.The empty/locked rooms will be allocated once things
settle down. Please be patient until then. All the unoccupied rooms can be
allotted on request from 17th October onwards. If you and some of your
friends agree to mutual shifting, we will sort out the issue after your
arrival.*

*2. Allotted rooms are occupied by PS or off-campus TS students?*
You may stay with your friend or get a room with the help of the respective
hostel superintendent for the time being. After 17th October, if required
depending on the vacancy, we will try to re-allocate you.

We expect your cooperation in the process and hope that you understand the
situation right now. Please be rest assured that we are with you in the
whole room allotment process and trying to do our best.

With best regards,

Reminder - BOSM Marathon | Run for a Cause,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:29:16 +0530","Greetings from NSS BITS PILANI,

This is a reminder mail for the BOSM Marathon which is to be held at 5:30
pm, today.

To move a step closer to our dream of a healthy BITS campus, Project Umang
in collaboration with FitBITS and Sports Council presents a run, a prequel
to the UMANG COLLECTION 2K19. This *3km/6.5km run* is to be held on
the *26th of
August (Today) at 5:30 pm* wherein the students and faculty members would
all come together to *Run for a Cause.*

We are extremely privileged to be born into good families who can support
all our education and our other basic needs but not everyone is as lucky as
we are.  Umang Collection is a nationally recognized 4 day campus
fundraiser in which we urge all the BITSians to donate so that we can
support the education of the economically backward section of the society
living in and around the area of Pilani.  Every person who donates is a
hero for these underprivileged students because they actually do change
someone=E2=80=99s life and we must not forget that *NOT ALL SUPERHEROES WEA=
R CAPES.*

This run is for everyone ranging from a beginner to a professional runner
and the run would be followed by e-certificates registered for all the
participating runners. With a number of props and photo booths set up, we
promise to make the run an enjoyable and memorable experience for you.

All the recipients are cordially invited to join us to promote the cause of
education for all the people living in and around the areas of Pilani.

        In view of the expected rise in the number of cases of Dengue
during the coming days, the following steps may help.

       Try to avoid sitting/standing  outdoors early mornings and evenings
before dark.

        Wear full sleeves shirts,pants and socks if you need to come out of
rooms at these times.Mosquito repellent creams may also be applied
instead.(The mosquito prefers biting at legs and feet).

         Use mosquito repellant like 'All Out','Good Night',etc inside the
rooms.Please keep one window open while using these so that the fumes don't
get collected inside.

         Dengue fever causes fever as high as 102 to 103 degree F with
severe headache,backache and nausea.There is no associated cough,runny nose
or sore throat.If any one has these symptoms

         he/she should take Paracetamol 650 mg (for those weighing more
than 50kg) and inform the Hostel Superintendent to seek medical help.(Each

Greetings!!!

 We are in the middle of a pandemic that has forced the teaching-learning
process to redefine itself in many ways. A remarkable effort has been put
by both the teaching fraternity and the students of BITS to create a
semblance of the =E2=80=9Cregular=E2=80=9D teaching-learning process in the=
se turbulent
times. While all of us are eagerly waiting for the reopening of the
on-campus classes, the Students' Academic Cell
<https://sacbitspilani.wordpress.com/> and the Teaching Learning Centre
<https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/tlc/Pilani/index.html>, want to solicit your
feedback on the online mode of education that the institute has adopted
this semester. This data will be very helpful to gauge the effectiveness
from point of view of both the stakeholders involved in the
teaching-learning process.


We will greatly appreciate if you will fill the google form survey which
will not more than 10 minutes of your time.

Next up, TLC and SAC are jointly planning to have an open online meet with =
all
the students and the faculty community to present the survey results and
discuss the proceeding of the online semester- the success, scope of
improvement, and preferably suggestions.


Let us all keep working towards achieving the common goal i.e., online

BITS Notice Board Announcement,Director Pilani <director@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>,"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 15:41:23 +0530","Dear All,

We are happy to announce the launch of BITS notice board portal (
https://onboard.bits-pilani.ac.in/). The portal will facilitate the posting
of general notices to all the user community and to specific targeted
groups.

Currently all the notices are sent through e-mail. The present system
supports mainly three groups namely student, Faculty and staff. The mails
can be sent to individual groups or to multiple groups. The present
facility does not offer mail delivery to the fine grained targeted email
groups causing the individual mailbox cluttering.

The team of IPC and SDET has taken up a new initiative and they have
created a portal which  aims to provide a single dashboard for the posting
and access to the various notices/announcements.

To begin with , we intend to provide notice posting rights to Head of
departments, division heads, faculty-in-charges  and unit heads. Once the
facility is operationalized, the root email facility will be withdrawn. The
individual faculty members will continue to use the Nalanda
email/announcement  facility to send the course related communication to
the students.
Hoping for your kind cooperation.

With the best regards,

Sudhirkumar Barai
Director, BITS Pilani-Pilani Campus

Message from CRT,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Fri, 2 Apr 2021 20:10:36 +0530","The country has witnessed an alarming increase in Covid-19 cases in the
last few days including Rajasthan. Kindly note there were only 60 new
infected cases on a single day on February 16 in the state, but it rose to
1,350 cases on April 1. On February 23, the total active cases were 1,195,
but on April 1, the number increased to 9,563.

All of you will agree that campus has been reasonably safe and secured due
to discipline from the campus residents. Now, tts high time that we become
all the more cautious. Hence, in order to keep our campus safe, cooperation
from all residents is required.

As a precautionary measure, the following steps will be implemented with
immediate effect.

(1) Students will not be allowed to go outside the campus, except for a
medical emergency.

(2) All cycles of student entry will remain suspended till further notice.
If a student decides to go home for any reason, he will not be allowed to
come back till further orders.

(3) The BITS faculty, staff, and their family members are discouraged to
leave the campus except for medical emergencies, to be approved by CMO.

(4) The BITS faculty, staff, and their family members coming from another
city have to produce a COVID- negative report (not older than 72 Hrs) of
RT-PCR or the final certificate of vaccination. In absence of such a
report, they have to meet the campus doctor and remain home isolated for 15
days.

(5) It is necessary for all visitors/Vendor/ technicians/supplier/ service
engineer, coming from other cities, to produce Covid- negative report not
older than 72 Hrs failing which the entry to the campus will be denied.

It=E2=80=99s the most critical time for all of us and hence, together we ca=
n save
the community from this pandemic.

Looking forward to your full cooperation. Thanking you in anticipation.
