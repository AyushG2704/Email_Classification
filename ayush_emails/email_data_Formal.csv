Every day, research and health professionals dedicate themselves to improvi=
ng outcomes for communities, patients, and society at large. And these effo=
rts are quite evident after the hard times of the Covid-19 pandemic where t=
hey must deliver accurate and precise information to the chaotic and misinf=
ormed world. During this process, they encounter unknown terms and concepts=
 and require background and contextual knowledge to progress almost at ever=
y stage. But finding one's path through a literature search can be overwhel=
ming. It is easy to be caught up in siloed information, untrusted sources a=
nd site hopping just to explore a single unknown idea or topic. Therefore, =
Elsevier brings a series of workshops in collaboration with ICMR to address=
 the solutions to these challenges and help researchers and healthcare prof=
essionals to contribute to Indian society. Elsevier, India starts its ICMR =
Publishing Webinar Series for the benefit of the research community in Indi=
a. Our Inaugural session is on 29th October from 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM (IST) d=
uring the International Open Access Week. Join our experts to learn the nua=
nces of OpenScience.

Dear Colleagues,
Good Morning to all of you. Nice to write an email to all Chemical
Engineering faculty of BITS Family. I understand that you are all busy with
just concluded mid semester tests and post test formalities.
Forwarded mail talks about a webinar titled "" Changing Face of Chemical
Engineering-Future Prospects and Career Opportunities"" being organized by
our department in collaboration with IIChE-Hyd Regional Centre on 31st
Oct-1st Nov (2-3 hours a day only). This is purely aimed at our UG students
(including 1st year as they would be completely unaware of the discipline)
and of course ME too . To be candid, we need to admit that many. If not
all, students of Chemical Engineering across the campuses are slightly
disinterested in their core discipline and are more inclined towards IT or
Finance due to their own reasons. Though there is nothing wrong in it per
se, we thought that we need to enlighten them about the beauty of our
discipline and its wide interdisciplinary outreach by inviting speakers
from Chem Engg background working in diverse industries like ONGC, space
research, materials, simulation and theoretical work etc. This is a small
attempt to make them closer to their branch and appreciate it better with
pride. I request all of you to make it convenient to attend the same (by
registering in a simple google form-free) and advise our chemical
engineering students of all campuses to make use of this opportunity by
attending the same. Please disseminate the information to all those
interested outside too.
PS: Please advise all participants to register online (free)
Thanking you in anticipation,
best wishes,
Dr I Sreedhar, (*On behalf of our organizing team Dr Satyapaul A Singh, Dr
Afkham Mir and Dr Iyman Abrar)*

Topic: Next Generation Core Banking Platforms

By

Venu Madhav Miriyala

Senior Vice President, FIS India

Economics and Computer Science - BITS Pilani, 1993 Batch

Core Banking Platforms are back-end systems that process banking
transactions across the various branches of a bank. The system essentially
includes deposit, loan, and credit processing. Among the integral core
banking services are floating new accounts, servicing loans, calculating
interests, processing deposits and withdrawals, and customer relationship
management activities.

Core banking systems are aimed at empowering existing and probable
customers to have greater freedom of their account transactions. With
technological evolutions, transactions are now safer, faster, and less
cumbersome. The fact that these transactions can be executed remotely, from
any part of the world has made core banking systems a significant aspect of
banking these days.

Venu Madhav Miriyala is a BITS Pilani alumnus from the batch of 1993

He is currently the Senior Vice President at Fidelity Information Services.
FIS is one of the world=E2=80=99s Largest Core Banking providers supporting=
 the
Core Processing Needs of 100=E2=80=99s of Banks across the world. Mr. Miriy=
ala is
leading the company's Global Next Generation Corebanking Engineering Centre=
.

He has spent more than 25 years in the Core Banking Domain working in many
countries and was involved in engineering multiple Core banking Platforms
from the ground up. His studies included courses in software
engineering, functional
programming, systems design, introduction to management science, and
project management.

Anti-ragging webinar in collaboration with S.A.V.E,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Sat, 9 Oct 2021 10:18:24 +0530","Greetings from NSS, BITS Pilani!

The relationship between seniors and juniors at BITS is a special one.
College seniors are supposed to be the first mentors for the young adults
far from home. But sometimes, in the name of introduction or initiation,
millions of students are brutally abused in many educational institutions.

Ragging and bullying are one of the leading causes of mental health
depreciation among students. Thus to change, spread awareness, and take
action, NSS, BITS PILANI has collaborated with S.A.V.E : Society Against
Violence in Education and invited Mr. Ajay Govind, Mr. Gaurav Singhal and
Mr. Shivam Yadav to enlighten about the harmful effects of ragging and help
us formulate a strong anti-ragging mindset.

About the Speakers

Ajay Govind is an award-winning filmmaker, educator and anti-ragging
activist. Being a graduate of St. Stephen's College (Delhi University), he
has interacted with over 15,000 participants. Ajay's anti-ragging
documentary film 'Thereby Hangs a Tale' has won accolades all across India
and has been associated with S.A.V.E.,(no2ragging.org) since last about a
decade when one of his close friends lost his life due to ragging.

Gaurav Singhal is Vice-President and the R.T.I. Cell Head of S.A.V.E.
Perturbed with the murder of a medical student in the name of ragging in
2009, he joined the Anti-Ragging N.G.O. S.A.V.E. Gaurav Singhal has also
appeared at various media like T.V., FM and Newspapers over the last few
years to spread awareness about the ragging issues. He was also invited to
Aamir Khan's show Satyamev Jayate to highlight the ragging problem in India.

Shivam Yadav, a pharma graduate, contacted SAVE as a victim in 2013 during
his college days and later started volunteering for SAVE. He provides
counselling for ragging victims and works in the Victim Supports Team of
SAVE and is instrumental in filing R.T.I.s to colleges and government
authorities and monitoring the cases in National AntiRagging Helpline.

We cordially invite you to the webinar, which commences 3:00 PM on October
10, Sunday. The talk will be streamed live on the YouTube channel of NSS
BITS Pilani on the following link:

Hostel Allotment (Revised),Chief Warden <chiefwarden@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>,"Sat, 9 Oct 2021 09:51:00 +0530","Dear Student,

Please find the revised list of allotments. We understand that many of you
are not getting a room as per your expectations. Remember one thing, once
you are on campus and meeting your friends, I am sure that you will forget
all the grievances you are having. In this phase, we have called the
students based on the availability of locked rooms. The data is very
dynamic due to many reasons.

Please find your allotment of the room from the
http://swd.bits-pilani.ac.in/Login.aspx.

Here are general answers to the queries you have posted.


*Common Queries:*

*1. Want a single room but have been allotted a double room?*



*We are aware of the fact that some of the rooms have been left unoccupied.
This is due to inadequate data because of the fast and dynamic process in
the current scenario.The empty/locked rooms will be allocated once things
settle down. Please be patient until then. All the unoccupied rooms can be
allotted on request from 17th October onwards. If you and some of your
friends agree to mutual shifting, we will sort out the issue after your
arrival.*

*2. Allotted rooms are occupied by PS or off-campus TS students?*
You may stay with your friend or get a room with the help of the respective
hostel superintendent for the time being. After 17th October, if required
depending on the vacancy, we will try to re-allocate you.

We expect your cooperation in the process and hope that you understand the
situation right now. Please be rest assured that we are with you in the
whole room allotment process and trying to do our best.

With best regards,

Special Invitation | Bhagavad Gita for Youth - Part 2 | Club SOVESA,VIPPUL JANGIRA <f20190751@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>,"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 13:09:15 +0530","Greetings on behalf of SOVESA!

I hope you find this email in the pink of your health. It gives me immense
pleasure to personally invite you to the 2nd part of our Discourse : Bhagav=
ad
Gita for Youth.


We were enthused to see active participation from the students in the 1st
part of the Discourse and we are feeling extreme delight to again invite
all the brilliant minds to take advantage of the jewel of the wisdom of
Bhagavad Gita.



Bhagavad Gita is said to contain R=C4=81ja-vidy=C4=81 i.e. the highest of a=
ll
knowledge and R=C4=81ja-guhya=E1=B9=81, i.e. the most confidential knowledg=
e=E2=80=A6.

r=C4=81ja-vidy=C4=81 r=C4=81ja-guhya=E1=B9=81

su-sukha=E1=B9=81 kartum avyayam

This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It
is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self
by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it
is joyfully performed. (BG 9.2)

Thus, understanding the seriousness of the message of the Gita, we wish to
lend a helping hand to all the genuine seekers of the Absolute Truth, to
the ones who are in search of answers to the basic questions of life, and
also to the ones, who want to experience a new dimension of life.

Course Objective:

Fundamental understanding of important verses in Bhagavad Gita for direct
application in daily life.

Following is the session plan for Part 2 :

To pacify the thirst of the intelligence that seeks an answer to the
mystery of the Creation and Sustenance of the Universe, we have planned to
organise a Spiritual Camp, INCEPTION, which aims at answering these
unanswered questions not just in a dry, theoretical or philosophical way,
but by practical experience.

WORKSHOP ON IMPORTANCE OF PATENT SEARCH,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Thu, 2 Sep 2021 15:51:05 +0530","Dear All



*Greeting from CIIE-BITS Pilani*



The role of intellectual property in the educational/research activity of
universities has greatly increased. Every researcher hopes that their work
is innovative and unique. To be protected by the law the new development
should be patentable (novel and inventive).



The journey from the conception of an idea, filing an application to the
grant of a patent can often be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive.
Therefore, it is essential to conduct a preliminary search of prior art to
get an idea of what technology already exists. It is, therefore, necessary
for academic researchers to carry out a patent search before they begin to
avoid repeating work that others have already done.



A patent search may not only help inventors decide whether to pursue
research but also allows them to find out avenues to modify their efforts
to improve the probability of getting a patent.



We invite your cordial presence in Virtual *WORKSHOP ON IMPORTANCE OF
PATENT SEARCH* on *8th September 2021 at 5:00 PM.*

*Abstract of the Talk:* Ranking users and items plays an important role in
social network analysis. Many prominent methods have been developed for
vertex ranking in unipartite networks and bipartite networks. However,
unipartite network ranking focuses on ranking for homogeneous networks,
where vertices are of the same type; bipartite network ranking targets the
task of ranking for bipartite networks, where vertices are of two different
types, but it only considers the inter-type links. In this paper, we study
the problem of ranking vertices of heterogeneous bipartite networks, where
the intra-type links and the inter-type links co-exist in networks. We
present a novel solution, VRank, which iteratively assigns scores to users
and items based on their mutual reinforcement and finally converges to a
unique stationary ranking. We prove that VRank iterates towards optimizing
a regularization function, which enables the extension of VRank to the more
generic heterogeneous n-partite networks. To illustrate its functionality,
we apply VRank on various real-world social networks. The experimental
results demonstrate VRank's effectiveness, efficiency and fast convergence.

*Title:*
Utilization of High-Performance Computing for Internal Combustion Engines



*Abstract*


Large scale high-fidelity simulations are being sought after to provide
unforeseen insights into complex industrial problems. Typically, such
simulations would require significant computational resources, codes
running on parallel computing. The present talk will provide an overview on
high-performance computing (HPC) =E2=80=93 hardware, operating system,
code-compatibility, best practices etc. The remaining part of
the talk would showcase the usage of HPC in the area of internal combustion
engines (ICE). Study of sprays is a vital topic to develop fundamental
understanding of combustion characteristics and pollutant formation for
liquid fuel. Despite the boost in the electrification of the transport
sector the application of ICE will be prevalent in the coming years.
Therefore, the room for further design optimizations will be there in order
to go beyond BS-VI norms. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation using HPC
facilities can play a significant role in speeding up the design process as
well as the understanding of inherent intricacies. The talk will conclude
with a review of the status of different energy resources at global level
and their impacts on the environment and how HPC based simulations can help
us in the dual demands of energy and environment.


*Speaker Profile*

usher in positive changes. He was awarded a prestigious International Ford

*Title of the *talk*: *""A New Algorithm to Compute the Influence of Users

Time: 04:00 PM

*Webinar Link: *meet.google.com/qif-eyxd-vvm


*Abstract of the Talk:* Ranking users and items plays an important role in
social network analysis. Many prominent methods have been developed for
vertex ranking in unipartite networks and bipartite networks. However,
unipartite network ranking focuses on ranking for homogeneous networks,
where vertices are of the same type; bipartite network ranking targets the
task of ranking for bipartite networks, where vertices are of two different
types, but it only considers the inter-type links. In this paper, we study
the problem of ranking vertices of heterogeneous bipartite networks, where
the intra-type links and the inter-type links co-exist in networks. We
present a novel solution, VRank, which iteratively assigns scores to users
and items based on their mutual reinforcement and finally converges to a
unique stationary ranking. We prove that VRank iterates towards optimizing
a regularization function, which enables the extension of VRank to the more
generic heterogeneous n-partite networks. To illustrate its functionality,
we apply VRank on various real-world social networks. The experimental
results demonstrate VRank's effectiveness, efficiency and fast convergence.

*Title of the *talk*: *""An Algorithmic Barrier to Neural Circuit

*Abstract of the talk: *Neuroscience is witnessing extraordinary progress
in experimental techniques, especially at the neural circuit level. These
advances are largely aimed at enabling us to understand precisely how
neural circuit computations mechanistically cause behaviour. Establishing
this type of causal understanding will require multiple perturbational (e.g
optogenetic) experiments. It has been unclear exactly how many such
experiments are needed and how this number scales with the size of the
nervous system in question. Here, using techniques from Theoretical
Computer Science, we prove that establishing the most extensive notions of
understanding need exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons,
in many cases, unless P = NP. Furthermore, using data and estimates, we
demonstrate that the feasible experimental regime is typically one where
the number of experiments one can perform scales sub-linearly in the number
of neurons in typical nervous systems. This remarkable gulf between the
worst-case and the feasible suggests an algorithmic barrier to such an
understanding. Determining which notions of understanding are
algorithmically tractable to establish in what contexts, thus, becomes an
important new direction for investigation.  will also close with some
speculation on if similar results might be true of sufficiently complex AI
systems.

(No prior Neuroscience background will be assumed for the talk.)

[PLACEMENT UNIT] Finance Committee || Courses Overview and Talk Recording,ANISHA SHEWANI <f20180569@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>,"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 18:41:00 +0530","Dear Students,

The Finance Committee aims at *inculcating a strong Finance Culture* in the
students of BITS Pilani and ensuring the best finance placements, internships,
informative sessions, interview preparation, workshops, simulation of
portfolio allocation, etc.

*CFA and FRM* are two of the most coveted certifications in the field of
finance, and in order to understand both the examinations from a
perspective tailor-made for BITSians, the Finance Committee had organized a
session on the topic. The *recording* of the session can be accessed
through this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5pZuf5hLGI> link and the
slides used in the session can be accessed by clicking here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xrc9rDQBzkAwoQmN3xagBhLTvqHcwyV5?usp=sharing>
.

During the talk, we also had a discussion around the introduction of an
additional level in *CFA (Level 4)*. Because it is a fairly new addition,
we couldn't dive deep into the topic at that time. We have attached a video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4vfxqgedOg> for your reference which will
help you gain a better understanding.

Since a lot of students have questions about the *finance courses offered
by the institute*, while choosing their electives for the term, we have
compiled the course overview drive
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CyYffJP7oF-TN6ALnP0im8C9aatyIE8Z?usp=sharing>,
a *collection of short presentations that give a bird's eye view of the
popular finance courses that are offered*. The slides contain information
about what's taught in the courses, what's their relevance, and how to ace
them. We hope that this will help you in selecting the right courses for
the upcoming semester.

The course material
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17bpWElBgZoW46VyRY68Qr4XRu38oCyOY?usp=sharing>
drive is a *one-stop destination for all previous year papers and other
resources* that will supplement your academic efforts through the semester
for finance courses.

Greetings from the Placement Unit!

Certification. If you=E2=80=99re thinking about becoming a financial analys=
t or
working with investments, these are the two designations that could advance
your career. Making the right choice is important because each of the
examinations takes a lot of hard work, money, and of course, a lot of
time. Keeping

   Engineering**)*. He has cleared his *FRM Level 1 *and is working
   full-time at *Credit Suisse*.


*Overview of the talk:*
The talk will cover the following points in detail:

   - Why and when you should pursue CFA/FRM?
   - How can you prepare for each of these exams?

Exclusive workshop for UPSC Aspirants | GGI Masterclass,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Fri, 13 Aug 2021 17:01:42 +0530"," *Should you have a Plan B while preparing for IAS?*

In early 2014, when the CEO of Global Governance Initiative (Ex-Government
of India, United Nations) started his IAS preparation one thought
constantly interrupted his mind - *What will he do if he ends up failing
the exam? *

1. *Game of Luck* - Out of 1 million who register for UPSC, around 90 make
it to the coveted IAS. Believe it or not, UPSC is a game of luck - after a
point in time

An exceptionally talented friend of his scored 165 in the interview, while
he scored 205 - not because he was better prepared, but because he was
stuck with a wrong board on a wrong day.

2. *2 Years Gap* - 3 stage exam requires a minimum of 1 year to prep before
the first attempt. It becomes extremely difficult to justify a lack of
practical skills and 2 years gap either for MBA Admissions or next
employment if you decide to pivot after 2 years.

Global Governance Initiative has designed an* invite-only* work-study
fellowship for UPSC aspirants (2nd, 3rd, and 4th years). Join the Founders
on 21st August 2021 for an exceptional opportunity.

*Next Steps : *

If you are planning to pursue a career in Civil Services then join the
Co-Founders of Global Governance Initiative (Boston Consulting Group/United
Nations/Government of India) for an Info-sessions on *21st August**,
Saturday, 2 PM- 3 PM IST  *

   for the applications in Round 2 of this unique initiative. *

"[Meity-sthub] Book Your Calendar Now: CoE-IP-MSH Webinar Series: ""Are
 Computer Related Inventions Patentable in India"" | 06/08/21 | 4 PM","""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Tue, 3 Aug 2021 09:59:04 +0530","Dear Colleagues,


Greetings of the day!


Continuing with the ongoing IPR Sensitization Webinar series we are now
conducting our 3rd workshop titled *=E2=80=9CAre Computer Related Invention=
s
Patentable in India=E2=80=9D* on 06th August, 2021 at 4 PM.


In recent times the protection of Computer-Related Inventions (CRIs) is one
of the most widely debated and contentious issues in the country and rest
of the world as well. The CRI Guidelines were earlier issued by the Indian
Patent Office to provide guidelines for the examination of patent
applications in the field of CRIs and to foster uniformity and consistency
in examining such applications.


With the rapid use of innovative technologies such as AI and ML by the star=
tups
an imminent need is felt for protecting such innovations in order to
prevent competitors from taking unfair advantage and copying the
innovations. Although patentability for this type of invention in India is
laid out in section 3(k) yet a great confusion often persists with its
rightful interpretation. Other challenges remain in terms of meeting the
criteria of =E2=80=98technical effect=E2=80=99 and demonstrating =E2=80=9Ct=
echnical contribution.=E2=80=99


To discuss about the guidelines related to CRIs along with its all
misgivings we have with us Mr. Siddharth Sharma, Principal Associate, Rahul
Chaudhry & Partners who will share his expertise on this very pertinent
topic for startups.


*Broad Canvass of issues to be covered: *


   - Guidelines for examination of CRIs in India
   - Issues surrounding the patentability of CRIs
   - Demystifying section 3(K) of the patents act
   - What types of CRIs would not be patentable
   - Patentability of AI technologies based on computer programmes in India
   - Recent case studies
   - Meeting Criteria of  =E2=80=9Ctechnical effects=E2=80=9D
   - Demonstrating =E2=80=9Ctechnical contribution=E2=80=9D
   - Patentability of CRIS in other patent jurisdictions



The presentation would be followed by a *question and answer* session.

The *Business Analytics Club, DoM, BITS Pilani* has come up with a unique
and exciting initiative to bridge the gap as demanded by current industry
trends while making you have fun too.


*R-Programming* is one of the most widely used *open-source statistical
software with a plethora of applications*. Being adept with it is essential
for any manager today to make effective *data driven decisions.*


While statistical analysis is of course, the primary use, did you know*,
you can also create some of the most attractive web applications,
dashboards and hey, even those mini games*? Once you have harnessed the
power of data, that is just what we will teach you next.


*Even better?* You may learn all of this from scratch with over *30+ hour
live sessions* in the vacation you have, from *28th July to 17th August,
2021*.


The sessions will be organized by our honourable faculty member, *Dr
Revendranath Tirumalsety. *And you would get to boost your resume with an
exciting *guided project in the domain of your choice* and a *certificate
by the* *Department of Management, BITS-Pilani.*



*The best part?* *The commitment will not end here*. This is only the first

Looking Beyond Coding by Kunal Shah,"""Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus"" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>","Thu, 22 Jul 2021 07:41:52 +0530"," *Ask Me Anything *
with
*KUNAL SHAH **of **CRED fame*

*""Looking beyond coding: Entrepreneurial skills that Engineering  doesn't
teach""*

We at BITS-Embryo(Pilani) are always looking to reach out to pioneers and
industry leaders and now we bring to you a talk from veteran founder and
venture capitalist *Kunal Shah* whose brainchild Cred achieved* Unicorn
status* in April 2021 with a valuation of*  USD 2.2 billion* just 29 months
after its inception (making it the *second-fastest Indian company *to ever
achieve Unicorn status).

Coming from a very modest background Kunal is a self-made serial
entrepreneur who is no stranger to financial hardship or the unglamorous
and excruciating reality of what it takes to make it big in the startup
scene. He has always been outspoken about the fact that coding is not the
most important factor when it comes to building a successful startup and
that is instead simply a means to an end. He maintains that most of the
make-or-break skills needed for a startup to flourish are difficult to
identify for someone new to the game and do not come from an engineering or
MBA degree.

Some of his core beliefs are:

i)The ability to ask dumb questions is a ""super-power"".
ii) Hiring multi-faceted individuals is key.
iii)Highlighting  Paranoia and Curiosity as key qualities that push a
person forward.
iv)The importance of collaborating and hunting in packs instead of treating
ventures as a zero-sum game.
v)The importance of experimenting and making new mistakes.


If you want to become an entrepreneur but are unclear on what that journey
actually entails then fill in the form with all your questions

*Greetings of the day!*


Continuing with our *IPR Sensitization workshop series,* we are now
conducting the second workshop titled =E2=80=9C*Patent Strategy for Tech St=
artups=E2=80=9D*
on 20th July at 4 PM.


Entities big or small, innovative startups or technology behemoths all need
to devise a sound patenting strategy if they want to succeed in the
intensely  competitive IP  led business processes.


Patents as part of the IPR strategy are a key element of IP portfolios and
must be acquired, managed, commercialized according to the mission,
objectives, and motivations of the organization that owns them. This is
especially true for innovation based startups and middle-sized companies to
design and implement an effective and cost-efficient strategy for patent
management.


To discuss all these and other pertinent issues we have with us an eminent
IPR Attorney *Mr. Naveen Suriya*, Partner, K&S Partners who is going to
address us on the topic *=E2=80=9CPatent Strategy for Tech Startups.=E2=80=
=9D*


*Broad Canvass of issues to be covered: *

   - Necessity of Patents
   - Timing strategies for Patents
   - Role of Patentability searches in the patenting strategy
   - Freedom to Operate
   - Understanding financial ramifications


The presentation would be followed by a *question and answer* session.

We gladly bring to you our newest venture =E2=80=9CBITS and Beyond=E2=80=9D=
, a podcast of
unscripted conversations with trailblazing BITSian alumni who have carved
their marks in diverse domains. The podcast aims at encapsulating the lives
of the placeholders of the BITSian hall of fame as they untwine their
journeys, talk about their future aspirations and share the values and
lessons they picked up on their way to where they stand today.

For the first episode of the podcast, we have with us Ms. Anamika
Aggarwal, currently
pursuing her PhD at NIKHEF based at CERN in the discipline of Particle
Physics. Ms.Anamika graduated from BITS Pilani in 2017 with a dual degree
in Msc. Physics and B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

Her recent exploits include working on the up-gradation of the ATLAS
experiment. CERN is a European Organization for Nuclear Research that
operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Established
in 1954, it is one of the world=E2=80=99s largest and most respected centre=
s for
scientific research.

You can listen to the podcast on Spotify to get a glimpse of her journey as
she talks about BITS Pilani, and how she discovered and carved out the
perfect niche for herself at CERN. We hope that this initiative lives up to
the cell=E2=80=99s motive of adding value to the lives of passionate BITSia=
ns.

Now, he's back to reveal the wax and wanes of his journey from BITS to
Hollywood.

*About the Talk: *

These* interactive talks*, delivered by the *alumni*, would most definitely
be a special connection to the heart of the attendees. Jyothi will talk
about how a* BITSian *can make use of the *various opportunities* at the
institute to catapult their profiles to be the best in what they aim to do.

Though this place has evolved a lot, the core feelings and echo of the
institute have remained the same over these years. Jyothi will talk about
his personal experiences coupled with an informal interaction that would
surely benefit all of the BITSians in continuing the legacy. He will also
touch upon his career in the film industry and his roles on the celluloid.


*About the Speaker:*

Jyothi Kalyan Sura is a storyteller, an engineer, and a leader.

His love for creative and technical storytelling led him to *DreamWorks
Animation India*, where he worked as a *Technical Director (TD*) for three
years on critically and commercially acclaimed films like *How To Train
Your Dragon 2, Pokemon Detective Pikachu, X-men Dark Phoenix *among others.
He left DreamWorks as the only TD to have an artistic demo-reel. Kalyan
spent his spare time *developing* *video games, VR, Animation* and *writing
fictional stories* - most notably, a 300-page fiction thriller novel,
inspired by events in India.

In May 2018, Kalyan completed his Master's in Film Production from USC's
prestigious School of Cinematic Arts with a focus on Writing, Directing and
Visual Effects. At USC, Kalyan wrote over *15 short films, two feature
screenplays* and* directed five films*. He helped over 20 productions in
various roles including *Sound, Editing and Visual Effects*. Kalyan also
served as the *President of the Visual Effects Society of USC.* Possessing
a rare blend of technical and creative skills that he can juggle with
sophisticated dexterity at will, Kalyan aims to work at the intersection of
storytelling and technology.
