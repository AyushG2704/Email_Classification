Kindly go through the video before coming to the class and it would help

Instructions for Latecomers in Lecture Classes (Section 3, Aakash Chand Rai=
)
by Aakash Chand Rai . - Thursday, 22 August 2019, 2:17 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear students,

I request you to please come to the lecture classes on time (before 9:01
am); however, if you're late to the class for any reason, please follow
these instructions:

1)=C2=A0=C2=A0DON'T ENTER THE CLASS AT YOUR OWN WISH.

2) Patiently wait outside the class - I will let you in (once there is a
sufficiently large group) after 5-10 minutes.

I again urge you to avoid coming late to the class since it creates
disturbance for me and the students. I also request your full cooperation
in this matter, and hope this helps to maintain discipline in the class,
especially at the beginning of the lectures.

Best regard,

Aakash C. Rai

Hope you are doing well.

Please note the following points-

1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 There is no Midsem examination for W=
orkshop Practice.

2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 If you are allowed for the makeup, t=
hen finish it before the
Midsem examinations.

3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Maximum two makeups are allowed in t=
he entire semester and
only in case of genuine reasons. If any makeup application is found with
false reasons, strict action will be taken that may cost him/her more than
the lab marks. So be honest.

4.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 If any student faces language proble=
m then he can contact to
the lab instructor of that particular section.

Your post compre marks are uploaded on Nalanda. Please cross check it and
inform me by today (May 29, 2021) 11 PM if there is any discrepancy.

The post compre average is 153 (of students who gave the compre) and 150
(overall, i.e. by including the CLEAR grade students).

Also, few of you were asking about the grading process. It will be done by
the rules set up by the department. I will try my best that the students
who opted for compre exam are not at loss.

All The Best....

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPRE TEST

Dear Student,

Please read the following instructions carefully to understand the protocol
for giving the DSA exam.

1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The exam is open book (BUT NOT OPEN INTERNET). A=
t any point in
time, if the invigilator finds that you were using the Internet and
browsing, your exam would be cancelled and the matter would be reported to
DC.

2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 You would use Mettl to see the question paper an=
d upload the
answers. There would be 7 questions. You would solve each question on A4
size sheets, scan them with your mobile, name the file with the=C2=A0QUESTI=
ON
NUMBERS AND YOUR BITS ID, and upload them on mettl. Also, you would upload
files on the google form (whose link would be shared during the exam). You
will have to make three pdfs and upload them individually on mettl as well
as on google form. Note that making pdf's take time; so start converting
your written answers to pdf's as soon as it is announced. Of course, you
can use gmail during this process.

3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Your exam would start at sharp 9:00 AM and end a=
t sharp 11:00
AM. You should stop writing at 11:00 AM. After that, you will get 10
minutes to upload the answers. WE STRICTLY REPEAT THAT DURING THESE 10
MINUTES YOU SHOULD NOT WRITE AND ONLY UPLOAD.

4.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 You should ensure proper continuous Internet con=
nectivity and
other things required. The exam time would not be measured using the clock
of Mettl; it would go by the physical clock. Please understand that this
decision is taken so that sincere student is not penalized. There would be
a penalty for each minute for a late submission.

5. Be ready to show the 360-degree view when asked by the invigilator.

6. Do not send me your files by Email as this would mean that you have not
done the things on time.

7. You can use ebook or lecture slides (but certainly not lecture videos).
Download them beforehand and do not open Nalanda or any other site during
the exam.

9. Write your answers to the point and neatly.

by Rahul Arora . - Thursday, 20 May 2021, 3:27 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Students,

Following are the final instructions for the comprehensive exam scheduled
tomorrow (21 May 2021) at 3 PM: [those who are going to appear tomorrow]

* Questions are divided into three sections: Section A, Section B, Section
C
* All questions are compulsory
* Part A contains MCQs with No Negative Marking
* Part B contains descriptive/numerical-type questions from the part
taught by Dr. Rahul
* Part C contains descriptive/numerical-type questions from the part
taught by Dr. Krishna
* Navigation between sections is allowed
* Calculator is allowed
* For Part B and Part C, you need to write your answers in the space
provided.=C2=A0You need=C2=A0NOT=C2=A0upload your answers separately and no=
 uploading
is allowed and available. Please write the main answer in a new line and
try to highlight it. We asked questions in such a way that you can manage
typing. Also do not forget to explain/interpret your answer. In economics,
without interpretation, a number does not have meaning.
* The exam would be of 120 minutes in total. Make sure that in the 120th
minute you click the submit/OK button and finish your test.
* In case of any disconnection in between and time wasted because of
reconnecting, extra 15 minutes (15 Maximum or the actual time if it is
lesser) will be given at the end to compensate for that time loss. No more
time would be given in any case. The link will be shared at 8:45 AM and the
exam can be started around 8:55 AM.=C2=A0
* Mettl note down your screen activities, your activities, and
activities/gadgets present in your room. So please be aware of it and be
honest while giving your exam.
* The exam is open book in the sense that you can refer to the slides,
e-copy of the textbook during the exam, and other lecture material shared
over NALANDA. Any extra material over the internet opened or seen during
the exam will be eligible for a penalty in terms of marks. Remember we are
looking at your screen activities also.

The syllabus you all knew. The concepts taught post-mid-sem. From the game
theory, you can leave the Max-min rule because that requires one class.
After the exam, for your information, I would share the two-page notes on
this for your learning only.

All the best
Rahul Arora (IC)

Dear Students,

PFA the PCT for the course ECON F211. The best three tests are taken to
count total marks. Average, minimum, and maximum marks are given at the
end. The syllabus for the comprehensive would be 50 percent of the total
course and as per our earlier email, it includes modules taught after
mid-sem. To be precise the concepts taught by Dr. Rahul and Dr. Krishna
(Module-wise - 7 to 12). Please see the course handout and lecture
recordings on Nalanda for more details.=C2=A0

The pattern would remain the same as followed for mid-sem exams. The
specific instructions would be communicated to you well in advance before
the comprehensive exam.=C2=A0

All the best

Regarding comprehensive exam portion and ""Cleared"" Grade consequences
by G Sai Sesha Chalapathi . - Tuesday, 4 May 2021, 5:21 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello Students

We have been receiving multiple queries regarding the comprehensive exam
portion and ""Cleared"" Grade option. We want to make two clarifications in
this regard

1) The portion for the comprehensive examination will be announced in two
days. Currently, our instructors are also badly affected due to the COVID
situation on the personal front and the campus lockdown situation in
Pilani. Thus, we were unable to arrive at a conclusive decision. BUT ONE
THING WE WANT TO CLARIFY IS ""BUSES"" TOPIC VIDEOS WILL NEITHER BE UPLOADED
NOR WILL BE INCLUDED FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION.

2) The ""Cleared"" Grade option was made known to us along with the students
themselves. Thus, we are yet to arrive at a decision as to how we will
treat the students who will be granted the ""Cleared"" Grade. We will clarify
this to whatever extent possible in two days.

Thank you for your patience.

Keep safe and healthy.=C2=A0

Concerns about Compre grading and Quiz rechecks
by Vishal Gupta . - Monday, 3 May 2021, 7:47 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi

Your DSA Quiz marks after rechecks are uploaded on Nalanda. Your lab marks
will be uploaded soon (within the next 2 to 3 days). Also, I will inform
your compre syllabus by tomorrow (just waiting for few clarities).

Moreover, a few of you are writing to me to know the grading process of the
DSA course. This is especially related to the newly introduced ""clear""
grade. Please note that it would not be only the IC's decision; rather it
would be the decision of the department. So, whatever the department would
come up with, it would be followed.=C2=A0

The only thing that I feel is you should see the purpose of a ""clear""
grade. It is introduced for those students who have their PCT marks; but
because of some problem related to covid19 pandemic cannot give compre,
neither want NC.

Dear Students,

Recheck is done and soon you all will receive a report from Mettl on
updated status. Question 2(B) is considered for partial marks and is
considered for all those who have used the mid-point formula correctlly for
both price, quantity, and correct explanation of TR (also checked for those
who have not applied for recheck for that question). This is on the basis
that at least you know the formula and its application. In case of any
further query (not new one) on your recheck request related to part B,
kindly contact to Dr. Rajan and he will do the needful but only within 24
hours.=C2=A0=C2=A0

Don't send any new recheck requests. Those will not be entertained.=C2=
=A0Those
who have submitted their answers on email, their recheck updates will be
received in a separate email shortly after this email.

Related to tomorrow's tutorial, THERE WILL NO TUTORIAL TOMORROW instead the
practice questions will be taken up by Dr. Krishna in the regular class on
Wednesday.=C2=A0=C2=A0

All the best

The topic of *Prakriti* is quite vast. I have tried to capture as much as

Just in case you missed seeing Post-Class Activity #11 (for 2 marks) on

A few of you have written about evaluation components. I'd like to hear

I am still having trouble releasing your scores for the Assignment #1 on

Postponement of Quiz1

Hi

Today I announced during the lecture that there will be a quiz component
(12% weightage) on Monday (Oct 04), 2021.

A few of you suggested conducting the component in offline mode on Monday
(Oct 18, 2021) when you all would be back in campus.

After discussing the matter with other instructors, we came to the
conclusion to conduct it in offline mode itself. The syllabus of the Quiz
will remain the same (i.e. Regular Languages).

So, there will be no Quiz on Oct 04, 2021.

Dear Students,

Mid-Sem evaluation is done. We are not displaying because of some confusion
over submissions of your answer sheets on two platforms (Mettl and email).
We are resolving all and then will publish the marks. We will do it most
probably by end of today and if not today then by tomorrow evening.

Please be patient.

Instructions for Quiz to be conducted today (March 12, 2021)
by Vishal Gupta . - Monday, 12 April 2021, 12:32 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Student,

Please read the following instructions carefully to understand the protocol
for giving the DSA Quiz dexam.

1.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The exam is open book (but not open Internet). At any=
 point in
time, if the invigilator finds that you were using the Internet and
browsing, your exam would be canceled and the matter would be reported to
DC.

2.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0You would use Mettl to see the question paper and upl=
oad the
answers. You would solve all the questions on A4 size sheets, scan them
with your mobile, name the file with your BITS ID, and upload it on mettl.

3.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Your exam would start at sharp 5:00 PM and end at sha=
rp 5:45 PM.
You should stop writing at 5:45 PM. After that, you will get 5 minutes to
upload the answers. I strictly repeat that during these 5 minutes you
should not write and only upload.

4.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0You should ensure proper continuous Internet connecti=
vity and
other things required. The exam time would not be measured using the clock
of Mettl; it would go by the physical clock. I would send announcements
periodically on mettl. Please understand that this decision is taken so
that sincere student is not penalized. There would be a penalty for each
minute for a late submission.

5. Be ready to show the 360-degree view when asked by the invigilator.

6. Do not send me your files by Email as this would mean that you have not
done the things on time.

7. You can use ebook or lecture slides (but certainly not lecture videos).
Download these beforehand.

8. Test link would be shared on Nalanda before the test. You can keep
Nalanda open in a tab during the test. In case of emergency (i.e. if
anything goes wrong during the test), check the announcement section of
Nalanda.

On the coming Tuesday (6th April 2021) instead of having a tutorial class,
you have to complete the take-home reading assignment which will be
discussed by the instructor on 7th April during the regular class. There
will be no separate tutorial classes on Tuesday instead you have to read
the attached material in detail and attend the regular class on 7th April.
It is mandatory and suggested to come to the class on 7th April with a
thorough reading so that you are able to give answers to the questions by
the instructor and can effectively participate in the discussion. After
having the discussion, the regular class will continue. The material is
uploaded on the NALANDA course page. I am again attaching it with this
email for your ready reference. The other regular classes will continue as

Dear Students

I hope you are enjoying programming in SQL. This is to inform you that the
monitoring of the Lab Quiz will be done through the Mettl platform.
However, because of scheduling reasons, the confirmation has not been
received from Mettl. Hence, we are going to have the evaluative component
in the next week instead of tomorrow. Prof. Mukesh Rohil will be taking the
regular live lecture tomorrow (1st April). The syllabus of the quiz
includes the topics covered in lab sheets 1 to lab sheets 8. You will be
required to write the SQL queries and submit the .sql file.

You are required to submit the .sql file at the google classroom course
page.
The test is for 35 minutes duration and will start at 11:00 AM (Proposed
date is 6th April, However, the exact date will be communicated after
confirmation).
